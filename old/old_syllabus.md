# Machine Learning for Finance

## Course Information
Instructor: Gary R. Engler Ph.D.

Email: gengler@stevens.edu


### Assignments
Assignments will be handed in the form of Docker images (https://www.docker.com/) to ensure they can run on any computer and prevent issues with dependance upon system particulars.  Sample Docker projects will be provided to understand how to build the assignments.

The ability to communicate lessons learned is important as such assignments will include a short video component which gives an explanation of the project and lessons learned as well as the Docker image and Github repository for the assignment.
